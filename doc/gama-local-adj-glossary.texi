@tab sum of weighted residuals v'Pv.
     @*The summation symbol [.] used to be popular in geodetic
     literiture, namely in connection with description of normal
     equations, during pre-computer era. It was introduced by Carl
     Friedrich Gauss who also introduce symbol P for weights (Latin
     pondus means weight). Letter V for adjustment reductions comes
     from German Verbesserung. @*We use [pvv] symbol only in html and
     text adjustment output. Sic transit gloria mundi.

@tab position of approximate coordinates xy of the adjusted point with
     respect to its confidence ellipse (g < 1 approximate coordinates
     are located inside the ellipse; g = 1 on the ellipse; g > 1
     outside the ellipse).  @*Zero value of g indicates that
     approximate and adjusted coordinates are identical. This
     situation typically happens when iterative adjustement is needed
     due to poor initial linearization (initial approximate
     coordinates are too far from the adjusted) and the iterative
     process ends up with identical approximate and adjusted
     coordinates.
