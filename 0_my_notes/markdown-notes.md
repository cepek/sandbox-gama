## Markdown notes

* HTML non-breaking space ```&nbsp;``` is used when three back ticks `` ``` ``
  occure at the beginning of a line, but the monospaced font applies only
  to a single word/phrase, like \`\`\````cmake```\`\`\`, for example.

* Code blocks are normally indented four spaces or one tab.
  When they’re in a list, indent them eight spaces or two tabs
